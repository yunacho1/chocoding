# Binary Stars
Winter 23-24 Coding

## Binary Stars Notes
- Optical Double Stars: Stars that appear close to each other
- Binary Star: Stars that physically orbit each other
  - 1/3 to 1/2 of all stars are part of a binary or multiple star system
- Types of Binary Stars
  - Visual Binary
    - the two stars can be seen separately using a telscope
    - important because with data on its orbit and its distance from the Earth, masses of the stars are determinable
    - the only way to accurately determine mass of a star is when it is in a binary system
    - mass provides crucial information about a star
  - Spectroscopic Binary
    - distance between stars is not sufficient for the system to be detected with telescopes
    - spectroscopy as a means to detect binary stars
    - using doppler shift in the stars' spectra
  - Multiple Star Systems
    - Mizar and Alcor, both their own spectroscopic system, constitute a sextuple star system
    - Polaris is a pentuple system
    - tend to be instable, since stars get ejected from systems
    - chemical fingerprint: stars in a system have a similar elemental composition
  - Eclipsing Binaries
    - edge-on orbits

    - from the dips, information such as size, mass, rotation rate, temperature, and distance may be determined
  - Contact Binaries
    - the two stars contact each other
    - mutual tidal effects change its form to a teardrop or peanut
    - algol paradox: mass transfer between higher mass and lower mass star
    - stellar novae
