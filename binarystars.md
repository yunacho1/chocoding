Winter 23-24 Coding

## Binary Stars Notes
- Optical Double Stars: Stars that appear close to each other
- Binary Star: Stars that physically orbit each other
  - 1/3 to 1/2 of all stars are part of a binary or multiple star system
- Types of Binary Stars
  - Visual Binary
    - the two stars can be seen separately using a telscope
    - important because with data on its orbit and its distance from the Earth, mass is determinable
    - the only way to accurately determine mass of a star is when it is in a binary system
